# Task Definition: T6.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T6.1
- **Task Name:** Code review and cleanup
- **Phase:** 6 (Refinement & Release)
- **Status:** Pending

## Description
Conduct a comprehensive code review of the entire codebase and perform cleanup to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. This involves identifying and fixing code smells, improving code organization, ensuring consistent coding style, and addressing technical debt. Code review and cleanup are essential for ensuring the long-term maintainability of the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Establish code review criteria and checklist
- [ ] Review all modules for code quality and best practices
- [ ] Identify and fix code smells and anti-patterns
- [ ] Ensure consistent coding style throughout the codebase
- [ ] Improve code organization and structure
- [ ] Refactor complex or unclear code
- [ ] Remove dead or commented-out code
- [ ] Optimize critical code paths
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Document code review findings and improvements

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Establish code review criteria:
   - Define coding standards and best practices
   - Create a code review checklist
   - Identify critical areas for review
   - Set up code quality metrics
2. Conduct code review:
   - Review all modules systematically
   - Check for adherence to coding standards
   - Identify code smells and anti-patterns
   - Assess code organization and structure
   - Evaluate error handling and logging
   - Check for performance issues
3. Perform code cleanup:
   - Fix identified issues and code smells
   - Refactor complex or unclear code
   - Improve naming and documentation
   - Remove dead or commented-out code
   - Standardize coding style
4. Optimize critical code paths:
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Implement optimizations for critical sections
   - Measure performance improvements
   - Document optimization techniques
5. Document improvements:
   - Record code review findings
   - Document major refactorings
   - Update technical documentation
   - Create guidelines for future development

## Dependencies
- Complete codebase with all components implemented
- Code quality tools (linters, static analyzers)
- Performance profiling tools
- Documentation of coding standards

## Estimated Effort
3-5 days

## Notes
- Consider using automated code quality tools (pylint, flake8, etc.)
- Focus on readability and maintainability over clever optimizations
- Consider the trade-off between code cleanup and stability
- Test thoroughly after refactoring to ensure functionality is preserved
- Document the rationale behind major refactorings
- Consider implementing code quality checks in the build process
- Be aware of the risk of introducing new bugs during cleanup
- Consider conducting pair programming or team reviews for critical sections
