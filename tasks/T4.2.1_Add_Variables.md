# Task Definition: T4.2.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.2.1
- **Task Name:** Add variables (Pose3, Point3, Cal3_*, Bias)
- **Phase:** 4 (Optimization Backend)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement functionality to create and add variables to the factor graph. These variables represent the unknown quantities that will be optimized during bundle adjustment, including vehicle poses, 3D landmarks, camera intrinsics, sensor extrinsics, and IMU biases. The variables must be properly structured and indexed for efficient optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement creation of pose variables (Pose3) for vehicle poses
- [x] Implement creation of landmark variables (Point3) for 3D points
- [x] Implement creation of camera intrinsic variables (Cal3_S2 or similar)
- [x] Implement creation of extrinsic variables (Pose3) for sensor-to-vehicle transforms
- [x] Implement creation of bias variables for IMU biases
- [x] Create a consistent naming scheme for variables
- [x] Implement a variable index for efficient lookup
- [x] Handle different variable parameterizations
- [x] Document the variable types and their meanings
- [x] Optimize for memory efficiency with large numbers of variables

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a variable creation module that:
   - Takes initial estimates as input
   - Creates GTSAM variables with appropriate types
   - Assigns unique keys to each variable
   - Adds variables to the initial values
2. Implement pose variable creation:
   - Create Pose3 variables for vehicle poses at keyframes
   - Use consistent coordinate system conventions
   - Handle different pose representations (rotation matrix, quaternion)
3. Implement landmark variable creation:
   - Create Point3 variables for 3D landmarks
   - Handle large numbers of landmarks efficiently
   - Support different landmark parameterizations
4. Implement calibration variable creation:
   - Create Cal3_S2 (or similar) variables for camera intrinsics
   - Create Pose3 variables for sensor extrinsics
   - Support different camera models (pinhole, fisheye)
5. Implement bias variable creation:
   - Create imuBias::ConstantBias variables for IMU biases
   - Support different bias models if needed
6. Implement variable indexing:
   - Create a symbol table using gtsam::Symbol
   - Implement methods for retrieving variables by ID
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions

## Dependencies
- GTSAM library (T4.1)
- Core data structures (Feature, Landmark, VehiclePose classes)
- Visual initialization pipeline (Phase 3)
- Motion estimation modules (Phase 2)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- The variable parameterization affects the optimization performance
- Document the coordinate system conventions for each variable type
- Consider memory usage for large-scale problems
- Test with different initial values to assess robustness
- Consider implementing variable ordering for better optimization performance
- Be aware of the limitations of different variable types
- Consider implementing custom variables for special cases
