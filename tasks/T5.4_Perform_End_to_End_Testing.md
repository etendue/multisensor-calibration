# Task Definition: T5.4

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T5.4
- **Task Name:** Perform end-to-end testing and debugging on datasets
- **Phase:** 5 (Integration, Validation & Documentation)
- **Status:** Pending

## Description
Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the calibration system using the acquired test datasets. This involves running the complete calibration pipeline on various datasets, analyzing the results, identifying and fixing issues, and validating the system's performance against the requirements. End-to-end testing is essential for ensuring the system works correctly in real-world scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define test protocols and success criteria
- [ ] Run the calibration pipeline on all test datasets
- [ ] Analyze calibration results and performance metrics
- [ ] Identify and document issues and limitations
- [ ] Fix critical issues and bugs
- [ ] Validate system performance against requirements
- [ ] Test with different configuration parameters
- [ ] Document testing process and results
- [ ] Create regression tests for future validation
- [ ] Prepare test reports with findings and recommendations

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Define test protocols:
   - Specify test datasets and scenarios
   - Define success criteria and metrics
   - Establish testing procedures
   - Create test documentation templates
2. Run end-to-end tests:
   - Execute the calibration pipeline on all test datasets
   - Use different configuration parameters
   - Record execution time and resource usage
   - Capture logs and intermediate results
3. Analyze results:
   - Calculate performance metrics (reprojection error, accuracy)
   - Compare results with ground truth where available
   - Identify patterns in successful and failed cases
   - Analyze sensitivity to different parameters
4. Debug and fix issues:
   - Identify root causes of failures
   - Implement fixes for critical issues
   - Verify fixes with regression testing
   - Document issues and solutions
5. Create test reports:
   - Summarize test results and findings
   - Document system performance
   - Highlight strengths and limitations
   - Provide recommendations for improvements

## Dependencies
- Complete calibration pipeline
- Test datasets (T5.3)
- Validation tools (T5.2)
- Documentation templates

## Estimated Effort
5-7 days

## Notes
- Consider automating the testing process for efficiency
- Document both successful and failed test cases
- Test with a wide range of datasets and configurations
- Consider implementing performance benchmarks
- Prioritize fixing critical issues that affect core functionality
- Document workarounds for known limitations
- Consider implementing A/B testing for comparing different approaches
- Be aware of the computational requirements for testing with large datasets
