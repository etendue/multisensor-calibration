# Task Definition: T4.2.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.2.2
- **Task Name:** Implement creation of reprojection factors with robust loss
- **Phase:** 4 (Optimization Backend)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement functionality to create reprojection factors for the factor graph. Reprojection factors constrain the 3D landmarks, camera poses, and calibration parameters based on 2D feature observations in the images. These factors are essential for the visual part of the calibration and should include robust loss functions to handle outliers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement creation of reprojection factors (GenericProjectionFactor or SmartProjectionFactor)
- [x] Integrate robust loss functions (Huber, Cauchy, etc.) for outlier handling
- [x] Support different camera models (pinhole, fisheye)
- [x] Handle multi-camera setups with different intrinsics
- [x] Implement proper noise models based on feature quality
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency with large numbers of observations
- [x] Document the reprojection factor creation process
- [x] Handle edge cases (features with few observations, degenerate configurations)

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a reprojection factor creation module that:
   - Takes feature observations, camera parameters, and configuration as input
   - Creates appropriate reprojection factors for each observation
   - Configures robust loss functions for outlier handling
   - Adds factors to the factor graph
2. Implement standard reprojection factors:
   - Use GenericProjectionFactor for standard reprojection
   - Connect landmark, camera pose, and calibration variables
   - Configure measurement noise based on feature quality
3. Implement smart factors (optional):
   - Use SmartProjectionFactor for landmarks with many observations
   - Configure triangulation parameters and thresholds
   - Handle landmark marginalization efficiently
4. Implement robust loss functions:
   - Integrate Huber, Cauchy, or other robust kernels
   - Configure loss function parameters based on expected noise
   - Document the characteristics of different loss functions
5. Support different camera models:
   - Handle pinhole camera model (Cal3_S2)
   - Support fisheye camera model if needed (Cal3Fisheye)
   - Handle different distortion models
6. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use efficient data structures for factor creation
   - Implement batch processing for similar factors
   - Consider using multi-threading for parallel factor creation

## Dependencies
- GTSAM library (T4.1)
- Variable creation module (T4.2.1)
- Core data structures (Feature, Landmark classes)
- Visual initialization pipeline (Phase 3)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- The choice between standard and smart factors depends on the problem size and structure
- Document the mathematical formulation of the reprojection error
- Consider the trade-off between robustness and computational efficiency
- Test with synthetic data containing outliers to assess robustness
- Consider implementing different factor types for different observation qualities
- Be aware of the limitations of different camera models
- Consider implementing custom factors for special cases
