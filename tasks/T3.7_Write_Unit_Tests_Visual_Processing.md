# Task Definition: T3.7

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T3.7
- **Task Name:** Write unit tests for feature detection, matching, triangulation
- **Phase:** 3 (Visual Processing & Initialization)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Develop comprehensive unit tests for the visual processing modules, including feature detection, matching, tracking, keyframe selection, and triangulation. These tests will verify the correctness and robustness of the visual processing pipeline, ensuring that it can accurately reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement unit tests for feature detection
- [x] Implement unit tests for feature matching and tracking
- [x] Implement unit tests for multi-camera feature matching
- [x] Implement unit tests for keyframe selection
- [x] Implement unit tests for triangulation
- [x] Implement unit tests for the complete visual initialization pipeline
- [x] Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- [x] Test with real-world data for practical validation
- [x] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [x] Achieve good test coverage for all visual processing modules
- [x] Document test cases and expected results

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Use a testing framework like pytest
2. Create test fixtures for synthetic and real-world data
3. Implement tests for feature detection:
   - Test different feature types (ORB, SIFT, FAST)
   - Test detection parameters
   - Test with different image types and conditions
4. Implement tests for feature matching and tracking:
   - Test different matching strategies
   - Test tracking across consecutive frames
   - Test outlier rejection
5. Implement tests for multi-camera matching:
   - Test matching between different camera views
   - Test with different camera configurations
   - Test with varying degrees of overlap
6. Implement tests for keyframe selection:
   - Test different selection strategies
   - Test adaptive selection
   - Test with different motion patterns
7. Implement tests for triangulation:
   - Test with known camera poses and feature correspondences
   - Test with different triangulation methods
   - Test outlier rejection
8. Implement tests for the complete pipeline:
   - Test end-to-end functionality
   - Test with different configurations
   - Test integration between components

## Dependencies
- pytest or another testing framework
- Feature detection module (T3.1)
- Feature matching and tracking module (T3.2)
- Multi-camera matching module (T3.3)
- Keyframe selection module (T3.4)
- Triangulation module (T3.5)
- Visual initialization pipeline (T3.6)
- Synthetic data generation tools

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- Create both unit tests (testing individual components) and integration tests (testing component interactions)
- Use synthetic data with known ground truth for quantitative evaluation
- Use real-world data for qualitative validation
- Consider using property-based testing for more thorough testing
- Create visualizations of test results for easier debugging
- Document any assumptions made in the tests
- Consider setting up continuous integration for automated testing
- Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable
