- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Document the integration and data flow
- [x] Ensure the integrated system produces accurate calibration results

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a unified interface for the optimization backend:
   - Define a common function signature for the optimization process
   - Support different optimization strategies
   - Return a consistent format for optimization results
2. Integrate factor graph construction:
   - Connect to the visual initialization and motion estimation modules
   - Create factor graphs based on the available data
   - Handle different factor types and configurations
3. Integrate optimization execution:
   - Configure the optimizer based on system settings
   - Execute the optimization process with proper error handling
   - Monitor and report optimization progress
4. Integrate results extraction:
   - Extract calibration parameters from optimized values
   - Convert to appropriate internal representation
   - Calculate quality metrics for the results
5. Configure integration based on system configuration:
   - Read parameters from the configuration file
   - Select the appropriate optimization strategy
   - Configure module-specific parameters
6. Implement error handling and recovery:
   - Detect and handle optimization failures
   - Implement fallback strategies for challenging cases
   - Provide meaningful error messages and diagnostics

## Dependencies
- Factor graph construction module (T4.2)
- Optimization execution module (T4.4)
- Results extraction module (T4.5)
- Visual initialization pipeline (Phase 3)
