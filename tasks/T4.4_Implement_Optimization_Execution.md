## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.4
- **Task Name:** Implement optimization execution logic

- [x] Implement optimization execution with proper error handling
- [x] Monitor and report optimization progress
- [x] Implement convergence criteria and early stopping
- [x] Handle optimization failures and recovery strategies
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Document the optimization process and parameters
- [x] Support incremental optimization for large problems

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create an optimization execution module that:
   - Takes a factor graph, initial values, and configuration as input
   - Configures the optimizer based on the provided settings
   - Executes the optimization process
   - Monitors convergence and reports progress
   - Returns the optimized values
2. Implement optimizer configuration:
   - Support different optimization algorithms (Levenberg-Marquardt, Gauss-Newton, Dogleg)
   - Configure algorithm-specific parameters (lambda, trust region, etc.)
   - Set up convergence criteria (relative error decrease, absolute error, iterations)
3. Implement optimization execution:
   - Create the appropriate optimizer (LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer, GaussNewtonOptimizer, DoglegOptimizer)
   - Execute the optimization process with proper error handling
   - Monitor and report optimization progress
   - Check for convergence and early stopping conditions
4. Implement failure handling:
   - Detect optimization failures (non-convergence, divergence)
   - Implement recovery strategies (parameter adjustment, reinitialization)
   - Provide meaningful error messages and diagnostics
5. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Configure linear solver parameters for large problems
   - Implement variable ordering for better performance
   - Support incremental optimization for large problems
