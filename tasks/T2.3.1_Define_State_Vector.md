# Task Definition: T2.3.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T2.3.1
- **Task Name:** Define state vector and noise parameters
- **Phase:** 2 (Initial Motion Estimation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Define the state vector and noise parameters for the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) used in the sensor fusion of IMU and wheel odometry data. The state vector should capture all relevant aspects of the vehicle's motion, and the noise parameters should accurately reflect the uncertainty in the measurements and process model.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define a comprehensive state vector that includes:
  - [x] Position (3D)
  - [x] Velocity (3D)
  - [x] Orientation (quaternion or rotation matrix)
  - [x] IMU biases (gyroscope and accelerometer)
- [x] Define process noise parameters for:
  - [x] IMU measurements (gyroscope and accelerometer)
  - [x] Bias random walk
- [x] Define measurement noise parameters for:
  - [x] Wheel odometry measurements
- [x] Implement proper error state representation for orientation
- [x] Document the state vector and noise parameter definitions
- [x] Make noise parameters configurable through the configuration file
- [x] Implement initialization of the state vector and covariance matrix

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Define the state vector structure:
   - Position: [x, y, z]
   - Velocity: [vx, vy, vz]
   - Orientation: quaternion [qw, qx, qy, qz] or rotation matrix
   - Gyroscope bias: [bg_x, bg_y, bg_z]
   - Accelerometer bias: [ba_x, ba_y, ba_z]
2. Define the error state vector for orientation:
   - Use a minimal representation (e.g., 3D rotation vector) for orientation error
3. Define process noise parameters:
   - Gyroscope noise density (rad/s/√Hz)
   - Accelerometer noise density (m/s²/√Hz)
   - Gyroscope bias random walk (rad/s²/√Hz)
   - Accelerometer bias random walk (m/s³/√Hz)
4. Define measurement noise parameters:
   - Wheel odometry position noise (m)
   - Wheel odometry velocity noise (m/s)
   - Wheel odometry orientation noise (rad)
5. Implement initialization:
   - Initialize position and velocity based on first measurements
   - Initialize orientation using gravity direction from accelerometer
   - Initialize biases to zero or provided values
   - Initialize covariance matrix with appropriate uncertainties

## Dependencies
- Core data structures (VehiclePose class)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)
- NumPy for numerical operations

## Estimated Effort
1-2 days

## Notes
- The choice of state representation affects the filter performance and complexity
- Document assumptions about sensor noise characteristics
- Consider the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency
- Test the sensitivity of the filter to different noise parameters
- Consider implementing adaptive noise parameters based on vehicle dynamics
- Ensure proper handling of quaternion normalization and singularities
- Document the coordinate system conventions used in the state vector
