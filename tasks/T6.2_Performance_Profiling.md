# Task Definition: T6.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T6.2
- **Task Name:** Performance profiling and optimization
- **Phase:** 6 (Refinement & Release)
- **Status:** Pending

## Description
Conduct performance profiling of the calibration system to identify bottlenecks and optimize the code to meet the performance requirements specified in NFR2 (processing a typical dataset within a reasonable timeframe on standard desktop hardware). This task involves measuring execution time of different components, identifying performance bottlenecks, and implementing optimizations to improve overall system performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Set up performance profiling infrastructure
- [ ] Measure execution time of key components (data loading, feature detection, triangulation, optimization)
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks in the system
- [ ] Implement optimizations for identified bottlenecks
- [ ] Verify that optimizations improve performance without affecting accuracy
- [ ] Document performance characteristics and optimization strategies
- [ ] Ensure the system meets the NFR2 requirement (processing a 10-minute dataset in < 2 hours)
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for future reference

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Set up profiling infrastructure:
   - Use Python's built-in profiling tools (cProfile, line_profiler)
   - Implement timing decorators for key functions
   - Create a benchmark dataset for consistent performance testing

2. Profile key components:
   - Data loading and synchronization
   - Feature detection and matching
   - Triangulation and SfM initialization
   - Factor graph construction
   - Bundle adjustment optimization

3. Identify optimization opportunities:
   - CPU-bound operations that could be parallelized
   - Memory-intensive operations that could be optimized
   - Redundant computations that could be cached
   - Algorithms that could be replaced with more efficient alternatives

4. Implement optimizations:
   - Parallelize CPU-bound operations using multiprocessing or threading
   - Optimize memory usage for large datasets
   - Implement caching for expensive computations
   - Replace inefficient algorithms with more efficient alternatives
   - Consider using compiled extensions (Cython, C++) for critical sections

5. Validate optimizations:
   - Measure performance improvement for each optimization
   - Verify that optimizations do not affect accuracy
   - Create performance regression tests

## Dependencies
- Complete implementation of all system components
- Test datasets for performance benchmarking
- Profiling tools (cProfile, line_profiler)

## Estimated Effort
3-5 days

## Notes
- Focus on the most computationally intensive parts of the system first
- Consider the trade-off between performance and code readability/maintainability
- Document performance characteristics and optimization strategies for future reference
- Consider hardware-specific optimizations (e.g., SIMD instructions, GPU acceleration) if appropriate
- Ensure that optimizations work across different platforms and hardware configurations
