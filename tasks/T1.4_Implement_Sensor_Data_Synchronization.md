# Task Definition: T1.4

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T1.4
- **Task Name:** Implement sensor data synchronization module
- **Phase:** 1 (Setup & Data Handling)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement a module to synchronize data from different sensors based on timestamps. This involves aligning measurements from cameras, IMU, and wheel encoders that were captured at different times and potentially at different rates. The synchronization is essential for accurate sensor fusion and calibration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement methods to sort all sensor data by timestamp
- [x] Support interpolation of sensor data to align with target timestamps
- [x] Support nearest-neighbor matching for non-interpolatable data (e.g., images)
- [x] Allow configuration of synchronization tolerance
- [x] Handle different sensor sampling rates appropriately
- [x] Support selection of a reference sensor for synchronization
- [x] Ensure proper handling of missing data
- [x] Document synchronization strategy and assumptions
- [x] Implement efficient algorithms for large datasets

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a synchronization function that takes multiple sensor data streams as input
2. Sort all data streams by timestamp
3. Implement interpolation methods for continuous data (IMU, wheel encoders):
   - Linear interpolation for position and acceleration
   - Spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) for orientation
4. Implement nearest-neighbor matching for discrete data (images):
   - Find the closest timestamp within a specified tolerance
   - Discard data points that don't have matches within tolerance
5. Allow configuration of:
   - Synchronization tolerance (maximum allowed time difference)
   - Target rate or reference sensor
   - Interpolation method
6. Return synchronized data as aligned lists or dictionaries
7. Provide appropriate error handling and logging

## Dependencies
- Core data structures (TimestampedData base class)
- NumPy for numerical operations
- SciPy for advanced interpolation (optional)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- Consider the trade-off between synchronization accuracy and data loss
- Document assumptions about sensor timing and clock synchronization
- Consider implementing different interpolation methods for different sensor types
- Test with datasets having varying sensor rates and timing patterns
- Consider implementing visualization tools for debugging synchronization issues
- Ensure the implementation is efficient for large datasets with thousands of measurements
