# Task Definition: T5.1.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T5.1.1
- **Task Name:** Fix result extraction in `extract_optimized_values` to handle different GTSAM versions and return types
- **Phase:** 5 (Integration, Validation & Documentation)
- **Status:** Pending

## Description
The current implementation of the `extract_optimized_values` function in the optimization module does not correctly handle different GTSAM versions and return types. This task involves refining the function to ensure it can properly extract calibration results from the optimized values returned by GTSAM, regardless of the GTSAM version or the specific return type.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Modify the `extract_optimized_values` function to handle different GTSAM return types
- [ ] Add support for extracting values from GTSAM's Values class
- [ ] Add support for extracting values from dictionary-like objects
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for unsupported return types
- [ ] Add type checking and validation for extracted values
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
- [ ] Write unit tests to verify the function works with different GTSAM versions
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the changes

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Detect the type of the optimized values object returned by GTSAM
2. Implement appropriate extraction methods for each supported type:
   - For GTSAM Values objects: Use the atPose3(), atPoint3(), atCal3_S2(), etc. methods
   - For dictionary-like objects: Use key-based access
3. Convert the extracted values to the appropriate internal representation
4. Validate the extracted values to ensure they are within reasonable bounds
5. Return the extracted values in a consistent format regardless of the input type

The function should be robust against different GTSAM versions, including:
- GTSAM 4.0.x
- GTSAM 4.1.x
- GTSAM built from source

## Dependencies
- GTSAM library
- Optimization module
- Variable index implementation

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- This task is critical for ensuring the calibration system works across different environments
- The implementation should be thoroughly tested with different GTSAM versions
- Consider adding a version detection mechanism to automatically adapt to the installed GTSAM version
- Document any assumptions or limitations in the implementation
