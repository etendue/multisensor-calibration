# Task Definition: T6.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T6.3
- **Task Name:** Finalize PRD and TDD documents based on implementation
- **Phase:** 6 (Refinement & Release)
- **Status:** Pending

## Description
Update and finalize the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Technical Design Document (TDD) based on the actual implementation. This involves reconciling the original design with the implemented system, documenting any deviations or enhancements, and ensuring the documentation accurately reflects the final product. Finalized documentation is essential for future maintenance and understanding of the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review the original PRD and TDD against the implemented system
- [ ] Identify and document deviations from the original design
- [ ] Update requirements based on implementation realities
- [ ] Refine technical design documentation to match the actual implementation
- [ ] Add implementation insights and lessons learned
- [ ] Update diagrams and illustrations to reflect the final system
- [ ] Ensure consistency between documentation and code
- [ ] Validate documentation accuracy with team members
- [ ] Format documents for readability and accessibility
- [ ] Finalize version numbers and document status

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Review original documents:
   - Compare original PRD and TDD with the implemented system
   - Identify areas of deviation or enhancement
   - Note requirements that were modified during implementation
   - Assess the completeness of the original documentation
2. Update the PRD:
   - Refine functional requirements based on implementation
   - Update non-functional requirements with actual performance
   - Document any scope changes or feature adjustments
   - Update success criteria based on testing results
3. Update the TDD:
   - Refine system architecture to match implementation
   - Update component descriptions and interfaces
   - Document actual algorithms and data structures used
   - Update diagrams to reflect the final system
4. Add implementation insights:
   - Document lessons learned during implementation
   - Note challenges and their solutions
   - Highlight successful approaches and techniques
   - Document known limitations and future improvements
5. Ensure document quality:
   - Check for consistency between documents and code
   - Verify accuracy of technical descriptions
   - Improve readability and organization
   - Format documents for accessibility

## Dependencies
- Complete implementation of all system components
- Original PRD and TDD documents
- Testing results and performance metrics
- Team feedback on implementation

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- Use LaTeX notation with dollar signs for mathematical symbols in documents
- Include diagrams or visual illustrations for core algorithm designs
- Ensure documentation is accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Consider creating an executive summary of key changes from original design
- Document rationale behind major design decisions and changes
- Consider implementing version control for documentation
- Be honest about limitations and areas for improvement
- Consider conducting a documentation review with team members
