# Task Definitions

This directory contains detailed task definitions for the Targetless Multisensor Calibration System project. Each task definition includes:

- Task information (ID, name, phase, status)
- Detailed description
- Acceptance criteria
- Implementation details
- Dependencies
- Estimated effort
- Additional notes

## Purpose

These task definitions serve as a reference for:
- Understanding the scope and requirements of each task
- Tracking progress against acceptance criteria
- Ensuring consistent implementation across tasks
- Providing context for new contributors
- Documenting design decisions and implementation details

## Structure

Task definitions are organized by task ID, following the structure in the [task plan](../doc/task_plan.md). Each file is named according to the pattern:

```
T<phase>.<task>_<Short_Description>.md
```

For example:
- `T1.3.3_Parse_Wheel_Encoder_Messages.md` for task T1.3.3
- `T4.2.3_Implement_IMU_Preintegration_Factors.md` for task T4.2.3

## Status Categories

Tasks are categorized by status:
- **Completed**: Tasks that have been implemented and meet all acceptance criteria
- **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on
- **Pending**: Tasks that have not yet been started

## Template

A [template](template.md) is provided for creating new task definitions. Use this template to ensure consistency across all task definitions.

## Relationship to Task Plan

These detailed task definitions complement the high-level [task plan](../doc/task_plan.md), providing more detailed information about each task. The task plan provides an overview of the project progress and timeline, while the task definitions provide detailed requirements and implementation guidance.
