# Task Definition: T2.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T2.1
- **Task Name:** Implement wheel odometry calculation module
- **Phase:** 2 (Initial Motion Estimation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement a module to calculate vehicle motion (position and orientation changes) from wheel encoder data. The module should support different vehicle models (differential drive, Ackermann steering) and handle both wheel speed and wheel position encoder data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement a WheelOdometry class to encapsulate wheel odometry calculations
- [x] Support differential drive vehicle model
- [x] Support Ackermann steering vehicle model
- [x] Handle wheel speed data (meters per second)
- [x] Handle wheel position data (encoder ticks)
- [x] Implement conversion from wheel speeds to vehicle motion (dx, dy, dtheta)
- [x] Implement pose integration to update vehicle pose based on wheel odometry
- [x] Handle edge cases (zero time difference, invalid data)
- [x] Make the implementation configurable through vehicle parameters

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a WheelOdometry class that takes vehicle parameters as input
2. Implement methods to calculate wheel speeds from encoder data
3. Implement methods for different vehicle models:
   - Differential drive: Calculate motion based on left/right wheel speeds
   - Ackermann steering: Calculate motion based on wheel speeds and steering angle
4. Implement a pose integration method to update the vehicle pose based on calculated motion
5. Handle edge cases such as zero time difference, invalid data, or encoder wrap-around

The vehicle parameters should include:
- Vehicle model (differential, ackermann)
- Wheel radius
- Track width (distance between left and right wheels)
- Wheelbase (distance between front and rear axles, for Ackermann model)
- Encoder parameters (ticks per revolution, using positions flag)

## Dependencies
- Data structures module (WheelEncoderData, VehiclePose classes)
- NumPy for numerical calculations

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- The implementation should be flexible enough to accommodate different vehicle configurations
- For position-based encoders, the system should track previous positions and handle wrap-around
- The module should be well-documented to explain the mathematical models used
- Consider adding visualization capabilities for debugging
