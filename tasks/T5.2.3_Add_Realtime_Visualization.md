# Task Definition: T5.2.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T5.2.3
- **Task Name:** Add real-time optimization progress visualization
- **Phase:** 5 (Integration, Validation & Documentation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement real-time visualization of the optimization progress, allowing users to monitor the calibration process as it unfolds. This includes displaying the evolving point cloud, camera trajectory, and convergence metrics during optimization. Real-time visualization provides valuable feedback on the optimization process and helps identify issues early.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement display of sparse point cloud of landmarks during optimization
- [x] Implement display of camera trajectory during optimization
- [x] Implement visualization of optimization convergence metrics
- [x] Add controls for landmark sampling and view manipulation
- [x] Create an interactive visualization interface
- [x] Update visualizations at appropriate intervals during optimization
- [x] Ensure visualization does not significantly slow down optimization
- [x] Make visualization parameters configurable
- [x] Document the visualization tools and controls
- [x] Support pausing and resuming optimization from the visualization interface

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a real-time visualization module that:
   - Connects to the optimization process
   - Receives updates at regular intervals
   - Updates visualizations based on current optimization state
   - Provides interactive controls for exploration
2. Implement point cloud visualization:
   - Display the current state of 3D landmarks
   - Update positions as optimization progresses
   - Color-code points based on various attributes
   - Implement sampling for large point clouds
3. Implement trajectory visualization:
   - Show the current camera trajectory
   - Update poses as optimization progresses
   - Highlight keyframes and current position
   - Use color coding for temporal information
4. Implement convergence visualization:
   - Plot error metrics over iterations
   - Show factor error distribution
   - Visualize parameter changes
   - Display optimization statistics
5. Implement interactive controls:
   - Add controls for view manipulation (rotation, zoom, pan)
   - Implement landmark sampling and filtering
   - Add options for color coding and visualization style
   - Support selection of specific elements for detailed inspection
6. Ensure efficient implementation:
   - Use appropriate update intervals
   - Implement efficient data transfer between optimization and visualization
   - Use level-of-detail techniques for large datasets
   - Support enabling/disabling visualization for performance

## Dependencies
- Optimization backend (Phase 4)
- Visualization tools (T5.2.2)
- Core data structures (Feature, Landmark, VehiclePose classes)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)
- Interactive visualization libraries (Open3D, plotly, etc.)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- Consider using a separate thread or process for visualization to avoid slowing down optimization
- Document the controls and features of the interactive visualization
- Test with a variety of datasets to ensure robust visualization
- Consider implementing recording of optimization progress for later playback
- Ensure visualizations are informative and not overwhelming
- Consider implementing user-configurable update intervals
- Be aware of the computational requirements for real-time visualization of large datasets
