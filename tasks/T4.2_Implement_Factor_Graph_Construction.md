# Task Definition: T4.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.2
- **Task Name:** Implement factor graph construction module
- **Phase:** 4 (Optimization Backend)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement a module for constructing factor graphs using GTSAM. The factor graph will represent the optimization problem for sensor calibration, including variables (poses, landmarks, intrinsics, extrinsics, biases) and factors (reprojection, IMU, odometry, priors). This module is the core of the optimization backend and will enable joint optimization of all calibration parameters.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement variable creation for poses, landmarks, intrinsics, extrinsics, and biases (T4.2.1)
- [x] Implement creation of reprojection factors with robust loss (T4.2.2)
- [x] Implement creation of IMU preintegration factors (T4.2.3)
- [x] Implement creation of custom wheel odometry factors (T4.2.4)
- [x] Implement creation of prior factors (T4.2.5)
- [x] Create a unified interface for factor graph construction
- [x] Implement variable and factor indexing for efficient lookup
- [x] Handle different optimization configurations
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Document the factor graph structure and components

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a factor graph construction module that:
   - Takes initial estimates, observations, and configuration as input
   - Creates variables for poses, landmarks, intrinsics, extrinsics, and biases
   - Creates factors connecting the variables based on observations
   - Returns the constructed factor graph and initial values
2. Implement variable creation:
   - Create pose variables (Pose3) for vehicle poses at keyframes
   - Create landmark variables (Point3) for 3D landmarks
   - Create calibration variables (Cal3_S2, Pose3) for intrinsics and extrinsics
   - Create bias variables (imuBias::ConstantBias) for IMU biases
3. Implement factor creation:
   - Create reprojection factors for visual observations
   - Create IMU factors for inertial measurements
   - Create odometry factors for wheel encoder measurements
   - Create prior factors for initial estimates
4. Implement variable and factor indexing:
   - Create a symbol table for efficient variable lookup
   - Implement methods for retrieving variables and factors by ID
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions for variables
5. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use smart factors where appropriate
   - Implement efficient data structures for factor creation
   - Use multi-threading for parallel factor creation

## Dependencies
- GTSAM library (T4.1)
