# Task Definition: T3.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T3.1
- **Task Name:** Integrate OpenCV for feature detection
- **Phase:** 3 (Visual Processing & Initialization)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Integrate OpenCV library for feature detection in camera images. This involves setting up the necessary interfaces to OpenCV, implementing feature detection algorithms (e.g., ORB, SIFT, FAST), and ensuring efficient processing of image data. Feature detection is a fundamental component of the visual processing pipeline and is essential for Structure from Motion (SfM).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Set up OpenCV integration in the project
- [x] Implement wrapper functions for feature detection algorithms
- [x] Support multiple feature types (ORB, SIFT, FAST, etc.)
- [x] Implement configurable detection parameters
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Handle error cases and edge conditions
- [x] Document the feature detection interface and parameters
- [x] Ensure consistent feature representation across the system
- [x] Implement visualization tools for detected features

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Set up OpenCV integration:
   - Import OpenCV modules
   - Handle version-specific differences
   - Set up error handling for OpenCV functions
2. Implement wrapper functions for feature detection:
   - Create a unified interface for different feature detectors
   - Support ORB, SIFT, FAST, and other common detectors
   - Convert OpenCV keypoints and descriptors to internal representation
3. Make detection parameters configurable:
   - Number of features to detect
   - Detection thresholds
   - Feature quality parameters
   - Non-maximal suppression parameters
4. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use appropriate image preprocessing (resizing, conversion to grayscale)
   - Implement region of interest (ROI) based detection
   - Use multi-threading for parallel processing of multiple images
5. Implement visualization tools:
   - Draw detected features on images
   - Visualize feature distribution
   - Create debug outputs for feature detection

## Dependencies
- OpenCV library
- Core data structures (ImageData, Feature classes)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- Consider the trade-off between feature quality and computational efficiency
- Document the characteristics of different feature types
- Test with a variety of images and lighting conditions
- Consider implementing adaptive parameters based on image content
- Ensure proper handling of image borders and regions with low texture
- Consider implementing feature filtering based on quality metrics
- Be aware of licensing implications when using certain feature detectors (e.g., SIFT)
