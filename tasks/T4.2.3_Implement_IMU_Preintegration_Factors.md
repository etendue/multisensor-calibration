# Task Definition: T4.2.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.2.3
- **Task Name:** Implement creation of IMU preintegration factors (ImuFactor)
- **Phase:** 4 (Optimization Backend)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement functionality to create IMU preintegration factors for the factor graph optimization. These factors will constrain consecutive poses based on IMU measurements, accounting for biases and noise characteristics. The implementation should use GTSAM's preintegration capabilities and properly configure noise models based on IMU specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement function to create IMU preintegration factors
- [x] Configure appropriate noise models for IMU measurements
- [x] Handle IMU biases correctly in the preintegration
- [x] Support different IMU sampling rates
- [x] Implement proper time handling for preintegration
- [x] Add IMU factors to the factor graph with correct variable connections
- [x] Document the preintegration parameters and assumptions
- [x] Handle edge cases (missing data, initialization)

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a function to build IMU preintegration factors:
   - Take IMU measurements between consecutive poses as input
   - Configure preintegration parameters based on IMU specifications
   - Create appropriate noise models for gyroscope and accelerometer
   - Handle bias estimation and correction

2. Use GTSAM's preintegration classes:
   - PreintegratedCombinedMeasurements for combined bias correction
   - PreintegrationCombinedParams for configuration

3. Configure preintegration parameters:
   - Gyroscope and accelerometer noise densities
   - Bias random walk parameters
   - Integration error parameters
   - Gravity vector in the world frame

4. Create and add factors to the graph:
   - Connect consecutive poses with IMU factors
   - Connect bias variables appropriately
   - Set up proper factor weighting

5. Handle special cases:
   - Initialization of the first pose
   - Missing or invalid IMU measurements
   - Different sampling rates

## Dependencies
- GTSAM library with IMU preintegration support
- Factor graph construction module
- IMU data structures and preprocessing
- Variable index management

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Notes
- IMU preintegration is mathematically complex and requires careful implementation
- The noise parameters significantly affect the optimization results and should be tuned carefully
- Consider implementing a calibration step for IMU noise parameters
- Document the mathematical formulation and assumptions
- Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- Consider the effects of gravity and Earth's rotation if high precision is required
