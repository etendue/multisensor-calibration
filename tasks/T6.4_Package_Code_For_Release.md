# Task Definition: T6.4

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T6.4
- **Task Name:** Package code for release/deployment
- **Phase:** 6 (Refinement & Release)
- **Status:** Pending

## Description
Prepare the codebase for release and deployment by creating appropriate packaging, ensuring all dependencies are properly specified, and providing installation methods for end users. This task involves creating a Python package, setting up installation scripts, and ensuring the system can be easily deployed in different environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create a proper Python package structure
- [ ] Set up setup.py or pyproject.toml with all necessary metadata
- [ ] Specify all dependencies with version constraints
- [ ] Create installation scripts for different platforms
- [ ] Implement version management
- [ ] Create a release process
- [ ] Test installation on different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Provide a Docker container for easy deployment
- [ ] Document the release and deployment process
- [ ] Create a change log for tracking versions
- [ ] Ensure all licensing requirements are met

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Set up Python packaging:
   - Create a proper package structure with __init__.py files
   - Set up setup.py or pyproject.toml with package metadata
   - Specify dependencies with appropriate version constraints
   - Configure entry points for command-line tools

2. Create installation methods:
   - pip installation from PyPI or GitHub
   - conda installation (if appropriate)
   - Docker container for isolated deployment
   - Installation scripts for different platforms

3. Implement version management:
   - Set up semantic versioning
   - Create a version tracking mechanism
   - Implement a change log

4. Create a release process:
   - Define steps for creating a new release
   - Set up continuous integration for testing
   - Create release artifacts (source distribution, wheel)
   - Document the release process

5. Test deployment:
   - Verify installation on different platforms
   - Test in different Python environments
   - Validate dependency resolution

## Dependencies
- Complete implementation of all system components
- Documentation (README, installation instructions)
- Testing infrastructure

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- Follow Python packaging best practices
- Consider using tools like poetry, flit, or setuptools for packaging
- Ensure all dependencies are properly specified with version constraints
- Test installation in clean environments to catch missing dependencies
- Consider creating a virtual environment for testing
- Document any platform-specific installation requirements
- Consider creating a Docker container for easy deployment
- Ensure all licensing requirements are met (including dependencies)
