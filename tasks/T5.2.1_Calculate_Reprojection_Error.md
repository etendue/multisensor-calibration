# Task Definition: T5.2.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T5.2.1
- **Task Name:** Calculate final RMS reprojection error
- **Phase:** 5 (Integration, Validation & Documentation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement functionality to calculate the final reprojection error statistics after optimization. Reprojection error is a key metric for assessing the quality of the calibration, measuring the difference between observed feature locations and their predicted locations based on the optimized parameters. This task involves computing comprehensive statistics and identifying potential issues in the calibration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement calculation of reprojection error for each feature observation
- [x] Compute RMS (Root Mean Square) reprojection error
- [x] Compute additional statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- [x] Calculate per-camera reprojection error statistics
- [x] Identify outliers and problematic features
- [x] Generate histograms and other statistical visualizations
- [x] Make calculation parameters configurable
- [x] Document the reprojection error calculation process
- [x] Ensure efficient calculation for large datasets

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a reprojection error calculation module that:
   - Takes optimized parameters and feature observations as input
   - Calculates reprojection error for each observation
   - Computes comprehensive statistics
   - Returns the calculated metrics and detailed results
2. Implement reprojection error calculation:
   - Project 3D landmarks into 2D image coordinates using optimized parameters
   - Calculate the Euclidean distance between projected and observed coordinates
   - Handle different camera models and distortion parameters
3. Compute statistics:
   - Calculate RMS error (primary metric)
   - Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation
   - Compute percentiles (e.g., 90th, 95th, 99th)
   - Calculate per-camera statistics
4. Identify outliers:
   - Define thresholds for outlier detection
   - Identify observations with high reprojection error
   - Group outliers by camera, landmark, or other criteria
5. Generate visualizations:
   - Create histograms of reprojection errors
   - Generate cumulative distribution plots
   - Create scatter plots of errors by camera or other factors
6. Make calculation configurable:
   - Allow specification of error thresholds
   - Support different statistical measures
   - Configure visualization options

## Dependencies
- Optimization backend (Phase 4)
- Core data structures (Feature, Landmark, CameraIntrinsics classes)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)
- Visualization libraries (matplotlib, etc.)

## Estimated Effort
1-2 days

## Notes
- Reprojection error is the primary metric for assessing calibration quality
- Document the interpretation of different statistical measures
- Consider implementing color-coded visualizations for easier interpretation
- Test with a variety of calibration results to ensure robust calculation
- Consider implementing export of detailed results for further analysis
- Ensure efficient calculation for datasets with thousands of observations
- Be aware of the impact of outliers on the overall statistics
