# Task Definition: T1.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T1.3
- **Task Name:** Implement data loader for ROS bags (or other chosen format)
- **Phase:** 1 (Setup & Data Handling)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement a data loading module that can read sensor data from ROS bag files or other supported formats. The module should extract image, IMU, and wheel encoder data and convert it into the internal data structures defined in T1.2. This task is essential for providing input data to the calibration system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement a platform-independent ROS bag reader that doesn't require a full ROS installation
- [x] Support both ROS1 (.bag) and ROS2 (directory with .db3 files) bag formats
- [x] Implement parsing for Image messages (T1.3.1)
- [x] Implement parsing for IMU messages (T1.3.2)
- [x] Implement parsing for Wheel Encoder messages (T1.3.3)
- [x] Handle compressed and uncompressed image formats
- [x] Implement proper error handling for missing or corrupted data
- [x] Support graceful degradation if certain dependencies are not available
- [x] Document supported message types and formats
- [x] Provide a unified interface for loading data regardless of source format

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Use the `rosbags` Python library for platform-independent ROS bag reading
2. Detect the input format (ROS1 bag, ROS2 bag, directory of images, etc.)
3. Extract data based on message types rather than specific topic names:
   - Images: `sensor_msgs/Image` and `sensor_msgs/CompressedImage`
   - IMU: `sensor_msgs/Imu`
   - Wheel encoders: Custom formats, `nav_msgs/Odometry`, `geometry_msgs/TwistStamped`
4. Convert ROS timestamps to seconds for internal representation
5. Handle compressed images using OpenCV for decompression
6. Provide appropriate error handling and logging
7. Implement a unified `load_data` function that abstracts the underlying format

## Dependencies
- `rosbags` Python library
- OpenCV for image processing
- Core data structures (T1.2)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Notes
- The implementation should be platform-independent and not require a full ROS installation
- Consider implementing a plugin architecture for supporting additional data formats
- Document assumptions about coordinate systems and units
- Provide examples of supported bag formats and message types
- Consider implementing data validation to catch common issues early
- Test with a variety of real-world bag files to ensure robustness
