# Task Definition: T5.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T5.3
- **Task Name:** Acquire or create suitable test and validation datasets
- **Phase:** 5 (Integration, Validation & Documentation)
- **Status:** Pending

## Description
Acquire or create comprehensive test and validation datasets for evaluating the calibration system. These datasets should include diverse motion patterns, different environments, and various sensor configurations. High-quality datasets with ground truth calibration are essential for validating the system's performance and accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify requirements for test datasets
- [ ] Acquire or create datasets with diverse motion patterns
- [ ] Acquire or create datasets with different environments (urban, highway, parking lots)
- [ ] Ensure datasets include all required sensor data (cameras, IMU, wheel encoders)
- [ ] Create synthetic datasets with known ground truth for quantitative evaluation
- [ ] Document dataset characteristics and usage
- [ ] Implement tools for dataset preparation and conversion
- [ ] Validate dataset quality and completeness
- [ ] Make datasets accessible to the development team
- [ ] Create a dataset catalog with metadata

3. Create synthetic datasets:
   - Implement simulation tools for generating synthetic data
   - Create scenarios with diverse motion and environments
   - Generate ground truth calibration parameters
   - Simulate sensor noise and imperfections
4. Implement dataset preparation tools:
   - Convert datasets to supported formats
   - Extract relevant sensor data
   - Synchronize and preprocess data
   - Validate dataset integrity
5. Create dataset documentation:
   - Document dataset characteristics
   - Provide usage instructions
   - Include metadata (sensor specifications, calibration parameters)
   - Create visualizations of dataset content

## Dependencies
- Data loading and synchronization modules (Phase 1)
- Simulation tools for synthetic data generation
