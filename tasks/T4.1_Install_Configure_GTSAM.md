# Task Definition: T4.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.1
- **Task Name:** Install and configure GTSAM Python wrapper
- **Phase:** 4 (Optimization Backend)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Set up the GTSAM (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping) library for use in the calibration system. GTSAM provides efficient factor graph optimization capabilities that are essential for the bundle adjustment and calibration process. This task involves installing the GTSAM Python wrapper, configuring it for the project, and creating utility functions for working with GTSAM.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Research and document GTSAM installation methods
- [x] Create installation scripts for different platforms
- [x] Implement graceful degradation if GTSAM is not available
- [x] Create utility functions for working with GTSAM
- [x] Implement version detection and compatibility checks
- [x] Document GTSAM usage in the project
- [x] Create examples of basic GTSAM functionality
- [x] Test GTSAM installation and functionality
- [x] Handle different GTSAM versions and APIs

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Research and document installation methods:
   - Conda installation: `conda install -c conda-forge gtsam`
   - Pip installation (if available)
   - Building from source
2. Create installation scripts:
   - Shell script for Linux/macOS
   - Batch script for Windows
   - Handle dependencies and prerequisites
3. Implement graceful degradation:
   - Check if GTSAM is available using try/except
   - Provide meaningful error messages if GTSAM is not available
   - Implement fallback functionality where possible
4. Create utility functions:
   - Wrappers for common GTSAM operations
   - Conversion between project data structures and GTSAM types
   - Error handling and debugging helpers
5. Implement version detection:
   - Check GTSAM version at runtime
   - Handle API differences between versions
   - Provide compatibility warnings if needed
6. Create documentation and examples:
   - Document GTSAM usage patterns in the project
   - Create simple examples of factor graph construction and optimization
   - Document common pitfalls and solutions

## Dependencies
- GTSAM library
- Python development environment
- Build tools (for source installation)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- GTSAM Python package is not available through pip and requires manual installation
- Use `conda install conda-forge::gtsam` instead of `pip install gtsam`
- GTSAM has complex dependencies that may be challenging to install on some platforms
- Consider providing a Docker container with GTSAM pre-installed
- Document known issues and workarounds for different platforms
- Be aware of API changes between GTSAM versions
- Consider implementing a minimal subset of functionality for testing without GTSAM
