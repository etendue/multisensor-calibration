# Task Definition: T4.2.4

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.2.4
- **Task Name:** Implement creation of custom wheel odometry factors with robust loss
- **Phase:** 4 (Optimization Backend)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement functionality to create custom wheel odometry factors for the factor graph. These factors constrain consecutive vehicle poses based on wheel encoder measurements, taking into account the vehicle kinematics and wheel configuration. The factors should include robust loss functions to handle outliers and slippage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement creation of custom wheel odometry factors
- [x] Support different vehicle models (differential drive, Ackermann)
- [x] Integrate robust loss functions for outlier handling
- [x] Implement proper noise models based on wheel encoder characteristics
- [x] Handle different wheel encoder types (speed, position)
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Document the wheel odometry factor creation process
- [x] Handle edge cases (wheel slippage, uneven terrain)

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a wheel odometry factor creation module that:
   - Takes wheel encoder measurements and vehicle parameters as input
   - Creates appropriate factors connecting consecutive poses
   - Configures robust loss functions for outlier handling
   - Adds factors to the factor graph
2. Implement custom wheel odometry factors:
   - Create a custom factor class derived from gtsam::NonlinearFactor
   - Implement the error function based on vehicle kinematics
   - Support different vehicle models (differential drive, Ackermann)
   - Handle the planar nature of wheel odometry (primarily constrains x, y, yaw)
3. Implement robust loss functions:
   - Integrate Huber, Cauchy, or other robust kernels
   - Configure loss function parameters based on expected noise
   - Document the characteristics of different loss functions
4. Implement noise models:
   - Configure measurement noise based on wheel encoder characteristics
   - Handle different noise levels for different surfaces and conditions
   - Support adaptive noise based on vehicle speed or other factors
5. Handle different wheel encoder types:
   - Support speed-based encoders (measuring wheel velocity)
   - Support position-based encoders (measuring wheel rotation)
   - Handle different units and conversion factors
6. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use efficient implementations of the error function
   - Implement analytical Jacobians if possible
   - Consider using factor graph simplification for long sequences

## Dependencies
- GTSAM library (T4.1)
- Variable creation module (T4.2.1)
- Wheel odometry module (T2.1)
- Core data structures (WheelEncoderData, VehiclePose classes)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- Custom factors require careful implementation of the error function and Jacobians
- Document the mathematical formulation of the wheel odometry constraint
- Consider the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency
- Test with synthetic data containing outliers to assess robustness
- Consider implementing different factor types for different vehicle models
- Be aware of the limitations of wheel odometry on slippery surfaces
- Consider implementing factors that partially constrain the pose (e.g., only x, y, yaw)
