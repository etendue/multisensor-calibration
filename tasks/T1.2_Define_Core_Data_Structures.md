# Task Definition: T1.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T1.2
- **Task Name:** Define and implement core data structures
- **Phase:** 1 (Setup & Data Handling)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Define and implement the core data structures that will be used throughout the calibration system. These include Python classes for representing sensor data (images, IMU, wheel encoders), calibration parameters (intrinsics, extrinsics), and system state (poses, landmarks). These data structures form the foundation of the entire system and will be used by all other components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define and implement a base class for timestamped data
- [x] Implement classes for sensor data:
  - [x] ImageData class for camera images
  - [x] ImuData class for IMU measurements
  - [x] WheelEncoderData class for wheel encoder measurements
- [x] Implement classes for calibration parameters:
  - [x] CameraIntrinsics class for camera intrinsic parameters
  - [x] Extrinsics class for sensor extrinsic parameters
- [x] Implement classes for system state:
  - [x] VehiclePose class for representing vehicle poses
  - [x] Feature class for 2D image features
  - [x] Landmark class for 3D landmarks
- [x] Ensure all classes have appropriate constructors, properties, and methods
- [x] Implement serialization/deserialization methods for persistence
- [x] Document all classes with clear docstrings
- [x] Write unit tests for all data structures

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a base TimestampedData class that includes:
   - Timestamp field (in seconds)
   - Comparison methods for sorting by timestamp

2. Create sensor data classes:
   - ImageData: Store image data, camera ID, and timestamp
   - ImuData: Store angular velocity, linear acceleration, and timestamp
   - WheelEncoderData: Store wheel speeds/positions and timestamp

3. Create calibration parameter classes:
   - CameraIntrinsics: Store focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients
   - Extrinsics: Store rotation and translation (6 DoF pose)

4. Create system state classes:
   - VehiclePose: Store timestamp, rotation matrix/quaternion, and translation vector
   - Feature: Store 2D image coordinates, descriptor, and associated landmark ID
   - Landmark: Store 3D position and associated feature observations

5. Implement utility methods:
   - Conversion between different representations (e.g., rotation matrix to quaternion)
   - Serialization to/from common formats (e.g., YAML, JSON)
   - Visualization helpers

## Dependencies
- NumPy for numerical operations
- OpenCV for image handling (optional)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- Use NumPy arrays for efficient numerical operations
- Consider using dataclasses or named tuples for simpler data structures
- Ensure consistent conventions for coordinate systems
- Document assumptions about units (e.g., meters, radians)
- Consider memory efficiency for large datasets
- Implement proper equality and comparison methods for testing
