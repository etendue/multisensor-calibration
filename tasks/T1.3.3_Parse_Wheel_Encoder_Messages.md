# Task Definition: T1.3.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T1.3.3
- **Task Name:** Parse Wheel Encoder messages (custom format or standard Odom)
- **Phase:** 1 (Setup & Data Handling)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement functionality to parse wheel encoder data from ROS bag files. The system should be able to handle both custom wheel encoder message formats (e.g., WheelReport) and standard ROS message types (e.g., Odometry, TwistStamped). The parsed data should be converted into a standardized internal representation for further processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Support parsing of custom WheelReport messages with wheel position data
- [x] Support parsing of custom WheelReport messages with wheel speed data
- [x] Support parsing of standard ROS Odometry messages
- [x] Support parsing of TwistStamped messages
- [x] Convert all message types to a standardized WheelEncoderData structure
- [x] Handle error cases gracefully (missing data, malformed messages)
- [x] Implement proper timestamp conversion from ROS time to seconds

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Detect the message type based on the connection information
2. Extract wheel data based on the detected message type:
   - For WheelReport messages: Extract wheel_position_report_data or wheel_speed_report_data
   - For Odometry messages: Convert linear and angular velocities to wheel speeds
   - For TwistStamped messages: Convert linear and angular velocities to wheel speeds
3. Store the extracted data in a WheelEncoderData object with the appropriate timestamp
4. Handle edge cases such as missing fields, different units, or unexpected message formats

The WheelEncoderData class should store:
- Timestamp (in seconds)
- Wheel speeds or positions for all four wheels [front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right]

## Dependencies
- Data structures module (WheelEncoderData class)
- ROS bag reader functionality
- TimestampedData base class

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- The implementation should be platform-independent and not require a full ROS installation
- For wheel position data, the system should handle encoder wrap-around correctly
- The implementation should be flexible enough to accommodate different vehicle configurations (differential drive, Ackermann steering)
- Documentation should be provided in the code to explain the parsing logic and assumptions
