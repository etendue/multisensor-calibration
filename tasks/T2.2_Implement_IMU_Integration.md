# Task Definition: T2.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T2.2
- **Task Name:** Implement basic IMU integration
- **Phase:** 2 (Initial Motion Estimation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement a module for basic IMU integration to estimate orientation and position changes from IMU measurements. This involves integrating angular velocity to estimate orientation and double-integrating linear acceleration (with gravity compensation) to estimate position. The IMU integration will provide an initial estimate of the vehicle's motion.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement orientation estimation from gyroscope measurements
- [x] Implement gravity compensation based on estimated orientation
- [x] Implement velocity and position estimation from accelerometer measurements
- [x] Handle IMU biases in the integration process
- [x] Implement different integration methods (Euler, midpoint, RK4)
- [x] Support different representations of orientation (Euler angles, quaternions, rotation matrices)
- [x] Handle edge cases (zero time difference, invalid measurements)
- [x] Document integration methods and assumptions
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create an IMU integration class that takes IMU measurements as input
2. Implement orientation estimation:
   - Integrate angular velocity to update orientation
   - Support different orientation representations (quaternions recommended)
   - Handle gyroscope bias
3. Implement gravity compensation:
   - Use estimated orientation to determine gravity direction
   - Subtract gravity from measured acceleration
4. Implement velocity and position estimation:
   - Integrate compensated acceleration to update velocity
   - Integrate velocity to update position
   - Handle accelerometer bias
5. Implement different integration methods:
   - Euler integration (first-order)
   - Midpoint method (second-order)
   - Runge-Kutta (fourth-order)
6. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Vectorize operations where possible
   - Avoid redundant calculations
   - Use efficient quaternion operations

## Dependencies
- Core data structures (ImuData, VehiclePose classes)
- NumPy for numerical operations
- SciPy for advanced integration methods (optional)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- IMU integration is prone to drift, especially for position estimation
- Document assumptions about IMU noise characteristics and biases
- Consider implementing zero-velocity updates or other drift mitigation techniques
- Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- Consider implementing visualization tools for debugging
- Ensure proper handling of coordinate system transformations
- Be aware of the limitations of IMU integration for long-term position estimation
