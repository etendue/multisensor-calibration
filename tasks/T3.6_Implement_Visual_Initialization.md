# Task Definition: T3.6

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T3.6
- **Task Name:** Implement visual initialization pipeline
- **Phase:** 3 (Visual Processing & Initialization)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement a comprehensive visual initialization pipeline that integrates feature detection, matching, keyframe selection, and triangulation to create an initial 3D reconstruction of the scene. This pipeline will establish the initial set of 3D landmarks and their corresponding 2D observations, which will be used as input for the subsequent optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Integrate feature detection, matching, and tracking modules
- [x] Integrate keyframe selection module
- [x] Integrate triangulation module
- [x] Implement a coherent pipeline for visual initialization
- [x] Handle multi-camera setups in the initialization
- [x] Implement outlier rejection and quality control
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Make initialization parameters configurable
- [x] Document the initialization pipeline and parameters
- [x] Implement visualization tools for the initialization results

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a unified pipeline that:
   - Detects features in all camera images
   - Tracks features across consecutive frames
   - Matches features between different camera views
   - Selects keyframes for reconstruction
   - Triangulates 3D landmarks from matched features
2. Implement initialization strategies:
   - Use the initial motion estimation as a starting point
   - Initialize the scene structure incrementally
   - Handle different camera configurations
3. Implement quality control:
   - Filter triangulated points based on reprojection error
   - Ensure good spatial distribution of landmarks
   - Detect and handle degenerate configurations
4. Handle multi-camera setups:
   - Coordinate initialization across all cameras
   - Establish a consistent coordinate system
   - Handle cases with limited overlap between cameras
5. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Process only selected keyframes
   - Use efficient data structures for feature management
   - Implement multi-threading for parallel processing
6. Implement visualization tools:
   - Visualize the reconstructed 3D points
   - Show camera poses and trajectories
   - Visualize feature tracks and reprojections

## Dependencies
- Feature detection module (T3.1)
- Feature matching and tracking module (T3.2)
- Multi-camera matching module (T3.3)
- Keyframe selection module (T3.4)
- Triangulation module (T3.5)
- Initial motion estimation (Phase 2)
- Core data structures (Feature, Landmark, VehiclePose classes)

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Notes
- The quality of the visual initialization significantly impacts the final calibration results
- Consider implementing multiple initialization strategies for different scenarios
- Test with a variety of environments and camera configurations
- Consider implementing a coarse-to-fine approach for initialization
- Ensure proper handling of scale ambiguity in monocular setups
- Document assumptions about the scene and camera configuration
- Be aware of the computational requirements for large datasets
