# Task Definition: T2.4

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T2.4
- **Task Name:** Write unit tests for odometry, IMU integration, and EKF steps
- **Phase:** 2 (Initial Motion Estimation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Develop comprehensive unit tests for the wheel odometry, IMU integration, and EKF/UKF modules to ensure their correctness and robustness. These tests will verify that the system can accurately estimate the vehicle's motion using sensor data and properly fuse measurements from different sensors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement unit tests for the wheel odometry module
- [x] Implement unit tests for the IMU integration module
- [x] Implement unit tests for the EKF/UKF state vector and noise parameters
- [x] Implement unit tests for the EKF/UKF prediction step
- [x] Implement unit tests for the EKF/UKF update step
- [x] Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- [x] Test edge cases (zero time difference, invalid measurements, etc.)
- [x] Test different vehicle models and configurations
- [x] Achieve good test coverage for all motion estimation modules
- [x] Document test cases and expected results

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Use a testing framework like pytest
2. Create test fixtures for synthetic sensor data
3. Implement tests for the wheel odometry module:
   - Test different vehicle models (differential drive, Ackermann)
   - Test conversion from wheel speeds to vehicle motion
   - Test pose integration
   - Test handling of edge cases
4. Implement tests for the IMU integration module:
   - Test orientation estimation
   - Test gravity compensation
   - Test velocity and position estimation
   - Test different integration methods
   - Test handling of biases
5. Implement tests for the EKF/UKF modules:
   - Test state vector initialization
   - Test prediction step with synthetic IMU data
   - Test update step with synthetic wheel odometry data
   - Test full filter operation with synthetic data
   - Test outlier rejection
   - Test numerical stability
6. Create synthetic datasets with known ground truth:
   - Simple trajectories (straight line, circle)
   - Complex trajectories with varying dynamics
   - Scenarios with sensor noise and outliers

## Dependencies
- pytest or another testing framework
- Wheel odometry module (T2.1)
- IMU integration module (T2.2)
- EKF/UKF modules (T2.3)
- NumPy for numerical operations

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- Consider using property-based testing for more thorough testing
- Create visualizations of test results for easier debugging
- Test with different levels of sensor noise to assess robustness
- Document any assumptions made in the tests
- Consider setting up continuous integration for automated testing
- Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable
- Consider implementing performance benchmarks as part of the tests
