# Task Definition: T2.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T2.3
- **Task Name:** Implement EKF/UKF for IMU + Wheel Odometry fusion
- **Phase:** 2 (Initial Motion Estimation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to fuse IMU and wheel odometry measurements for improved ego-motion estimation. This fusion will provide a more accurate initial estimate of the vehicle's trajectory by combining the complementary strengths of IMU (good short-term accuracy, high rate) and wheel odometry (less drift in position).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define appropriate state vector and noise parameters (T2.3.1)
- [x] Implement prediction step using IMU measurements (T2.3.2)
- [x] Implement update step using wheel odometry measurements (T2.3.3)
- [x] Support different filter types (EKF, UKF)
- [x] Handle non-linearities in the system model
- [x] Implement proper error state representation for orientation
- [x] Handle asynchronous measurements from different sensors
- [x] Implement outlier rejection for wheel odometry measurements
- [x] Document filter design and assumptions
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Define the state vector to include:
   - Position (3D)
   - Velocity (3D)
   - Orientation (quaternion or rotation matrix)
   - IMU biases (gyroscope and accelerometer)
2. Implement the prediction step:
   - Use IMU measurements to propagate the state
   - Update the state covariance using the process noise
   - Handle quaternion normalization
3. Implement the update step:
   - Use wheel odometry measurements to correct the state
   - Calculate the Kalman gain
   - Update the state and covariance
4. Implement outlier rejection:
   - Calculate Mahalanobis distance for measurements
   - Reject measurements that exceed a threshold
5. Handle asynchronous measurements:
   - Process measurements in timestamp order
   - Propagate the state to the measurement time
6. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use sparse matrix operations where possible
   - Implement efficient quaternion operations
   - Avoid redundant calculations

## Dependencies
- Core data structures (ImuData, WheelEncoderData, VehiclePose classes)
- IMU integration module (T2.2)
- Wheel odometry module (T2.1)
- NumPy and SciPy for numerical operations

## Estimated Effort
5-7 days

## Notes
- The choice between EKF and UKF depends on the non-linearity of the system
- Document assumptions about sensor noise characteristics
- Consider implementing smoothing in addition to filtering for offline processing
- Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- Consider implementing visualization tools for debugging
- Be aware of the limitations of the filter for long-term estimation
- Consider implementing adaptive noise parameters based on vehicle dynamics
