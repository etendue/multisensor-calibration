# Task Definition: T3.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T3.3
- **Task Name:** Implement multi-camera feature matching logic
- **Phase:** 3 (Visual Processing & Initialization)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement logic for matching features across multiple cameras at similar timestamps. This involves establishing correspondences between features detected in different camera views of the same scene, taking into account the spatial relationships between cameras. Multi-camera feature matching is essential for creating a consistent 3D reconstruction across the entire field of view of the vehicle.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement feature matching between different camera views at the same timestamp
- [x] Handle the spatial relationship between cameras (overlapping fields of view)
- [x] Support different matching strategies for multi-camera matching
- [x] Implement geometric verification specific to multi-camera setups
- [x] Handle cases with limited or no overlap between camera views
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Make multi-camera matching parameters configurable
- [x] Document the multi-camera matching interface and parameters
- [x] Implement visualization tools for multi-camera matches

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Implement multi-camera feature matching:
   - Match features between pairs of cameras with overlapping fields of view
   - Use the initial extrinsic calibration to guide the matching process
   - Handle different camera resolutions and intrinsic parameters
2. Implement matching strategies specific to multi-camera setups:
   - Use epipolar constraints based on initial extrinsics
   - Implement guided matching using the initial extrinsics
   - Support different descriptor-based matching methods
3. Implement geometric verification:
   - Use RANSAC with essential matrix for calibrated cameras
   - Calculate inlier ratio and other quality metrics
   - Verify consistency with the initial extrinsic calibration
4. Handle limited overlap:
   - Detect and handle cases with limited or no overlap
   - Implement strategies for indirect matching through intermediate views
   - Use temporal information to enhance matching in challenging cases
5. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Focus matching on regions with potential overlap
   - Implement multi-threading for parallel processing
   - Use efficient data structures for matching
6. Implement visualization tools:
   - Visualize matches between different camera views
   - Create composite views showing matched features
   - Generate debug outputs for multi-camera matching

## Dependencies
- Feature detection module (T3.1)
- Feature matching module (T3.2)
- Core data structures (Feature, Match classes)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)
- Initial extrinsic calibration

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- The quality of multi-camera matching depends on the accuracy of the initial extrinsic calibration
- Consider the trade-off between matching accuracy and computational efficiency
- Test with different camera configurations (overlapping, non-overlapping)
- Consider implementing a graph-based approach for connecting features across multiple views
- Ensure proper handling of scale differences between cameras
- Document assumptions about the camera configuration
- Be aware of the challenges in matching features between cameras with different characteristics
