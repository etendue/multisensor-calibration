# Task Definition: T3.5

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T3.5
- **Task Name:** Implement feature triangulation function
- **Phase:** 3 (Visual Processing & Initialization)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement a function to triangulate 3D landmark positions from 2D feature correspondences across multiple camera views. The triangulation should use the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm or similar methods to estimate the 3D position of landmarks from matched features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement a triangulation function using the DLT algorithm
- [x] Support triangulation from two or more views
- [x] Handle camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters correctly
- [x] Implement outlier rejection for triangulation results
- [x] Calculate reprojection error for triangulated points
- [x] Support non-linear refinement of triangulated points
- [x] Handle degenerate cases (e.g., points at infinity, parallel rays)
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a triangulation function that takes as input:
   - 2D feature correspondences across multiple views
   - Camera intrinsic parameters for each view
   - Camera extrinsic parameters (poses) for each view
2. Implement the DLT algorithm:
   - Formulate the linear system based on the projection equations
   - Solve the system using SVD or other appropriate methods
   - Extract the 3D point from the solution
3. Implement outlier rejection:
   - Calculate reprojection error for each view
   - Reject points with high reprojection error
   - Reject points with negative depth (behind the camera)
4. Implement non-linear refinement:
   - Use the DLT result as initial guess
   - Minimize reprojection error using non-linear optimization
   - Return the refined 3D point

The function should handle:
- Different camera models (pinhole, with/without distortion)
- Variable number of views (â‰¥2)
- Numerical stability issues
- Degenerate configurations

## Dependencies
- Linear algebra functions (NumPy, SciPy)
- Camera projection models
- Feature matching results
- Non-linear optimization (e.g., scipy.optimize)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- The triangulation function is a critical component of the SfM pipeline
- Consider implementing both linear (DLT) and non-linear methods
- Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- Document the mathematical formulation of the triangulation problem
- Consider implementing RANSAC for robust triangulation
