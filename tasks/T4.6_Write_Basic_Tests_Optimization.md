# Task Definition: T4.6

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.6
- **Task Name:** Write basic tests for factor creation and optimization call
- **Phase:** 4 (Optimization Backend)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Develop basic tests for the factor graph construction and optimization modules to ensure their correctness and robustness. These tests will verify that the system can properly create factor graphs, populate initial values, execute optimization, and extract results. The tests should cover both simple synthetic cases and more complex realistic scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement tests for variable creation
- [x] Implement tests for reprojection factor creation
- [x] Implement tests for IMU factor creation
- [x] Implement tests for wheel odometry factor creation
- [x] Implement tests for prior factor creation
- [x] Implement tests for initial value population
- [x] Implement tests for optimization execution
- [x] Implement tests for results extraction
- [x] Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- [x] Test with realistic data for practical validation
- [x] Document test cases and expected results

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Use a testing framework like pytest
2. Create test fixtures for synthetic and realistic data
3. Implement tests for variable creation:
   - Test creation of different variable types
   - Test variable indexing and retrieval
   - Test handling of different initial values
4. Implement tests for factor creation:
   - Test creation of reprojection factors
   - Test creation of IMU factors
   - Test creation of wheel odometry factors
   - Test creation of prior factors
   - Test factor indexing and retrieval
5. Implement tests for initial value population:
   - Test population from different data sources
   - Test handling of missing or inconsistent data
   - Test conversion between internal and GTSAM representations
6. Implement tests for optimization execution:
   - Test different optimization algorithms
   - Test convergence monitoring
   - Test handling of optimization failures
7. Implement tests for results extraction:
   - Test extraction of different parameter types
   - Test handling of different GTSAM return types
   - Test conversion between GTSAM and internal representations
8. Create synthetic test cases:
   - Simple scenarios with known ground truth
   - More complex scenarios with realistic noise
   - Edge cases and failure modes

## Dependencies
- pytest or another testing framework
- GTSAM library (T4.1)
- Factor graph construction module (T4.2)
- Initial values logic (T4.3)
- Optimization execution module (T4.4)
- Results extraction module (T4.5)
- Synthetic data generation tools

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- Create both unit tests (testing individual components) and integration tests (testing component interactions)
- Use synthetic data with known ground truth for quantitative evaluation
- Use realistic data for qualitative validation
- Consider using property-based testing for more thorough testing
- Create visualizations of test results for easier debugging
- Document any assumptions made in the tests
- Consider setting up continuous integration for automated testing
- Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable
