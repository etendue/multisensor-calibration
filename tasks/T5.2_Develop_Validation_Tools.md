# Task Definition: T5.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T5.2
- **Task Name:** Develop validation tools
- **Phase:** 5 (Integration, Validation & Documentation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Develop tools for validating the calibration results, including metrics for assessing calibration quality and visualizations for inspecting the results. These tools will help users evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the calibration, identify potential issues, and understand the calibration process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement calculation of reprojection error statistics (T5.2.1)
- [x] Implement visualization tools for calibration results (T5.2.2)
- [x] Implement real-time optimization progress visualization (T5.2.3)
- [x] Create a unified interface for validation tools
- [x] Support different validation metrics and visualizations
- [x] Make validation tools configurable
- [x] Document the validation process and metrics
- [x] Ensure validation tools are user-friendly and informative

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Implement reprojection error calculation:
   - Calculate reprojection error for each feature observation
   - Compute statistics (mean, median, RMS, histogram)
   - Identify outliers and problematic features
   - Generate reports and visualizations
2. Implement visualization tools:
   - Visualize camera poses and trajectories
   - Visualize 3D landmarks and scene structure
   - Visualize reprojection errors on images
   - Create interactive visualizations where possible
3. Implement optimization progress visualization:
   - Display sparse point cloud of landmarks
   - Show camera trajectory
   - Visualize optimization convergence metrics
   - Add controls for landmark sampling and view manipulation
4. Create a unified interface:
   - Define common function signatures for validation tools
   - Support different visualization backends
   - Make tools accessible from the main pipeline
5. Make tools configurable:
   - Read parameters from the configuration file
   - Support different visualization options
   - Allow customization of metrics and thresholds
6. Document the validation process:
   - Explain the meaning of different metrics
   - Provide guidelines for interpreting results
   - Document visualization controls and features

## Dependencies
- Optimization backend (Phase 4)
- Visual initialization pipeline (Phase 3)
- Core data structures (Feature, Landmark, VehiclePose classes)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)
- Visualization libraries (matplotlib, Open3D, etc.)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- Consider using interactive visualizations for better user experience
- Document the interpretation of different validation metrics
- Test with a variety of calibration results to ensure robust validation
- Consider implementing export of validation results to common formats
- Ensure visualizations are informative and not overwhelming
- Consider implementing comparison tools for different calibration runs
- Be aware of the computational requirements for visualization of large datasets
