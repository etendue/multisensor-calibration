# Task Definition: T1.3.1

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T1.3.1
- **Task Name:** Parse Image messages
- **Phase:** 1 (Setup & Data Handling)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement functionality to parse image messages from ROS bag files and convert them into the internal ImageData structure. This includes handling both raw and compressed image formats, extracting camera information, and ensuring proper timestamp conversion.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Support parsing of `sensor_msgs/Image` messages
- [x] Support parsing of `sensor_msgs/CompressedImage` messages
- [x] Extract image data, camera ID, and timestamp from messages
- [x] Handle different image encodings (RGB, BGR, mono, etc.)
- [x] Decompress compressed images using OpenCV
- [x] Convert ROS timestamps to seconds for internal representation
- [x] Handle error cases gracefully (missing data, unsupported encodings)
- [x] Support H.264 video decoding from rosbags
- [x] Skip frames that fail to decode (due to intermediate I-frames vs P-frames)

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Detect the message type based on the connection information
2. For `sensor_msgs/Image` messages:
   - Extract the raw image data
   - Convert the encoding to a format compatible with OpenCV
   - Create an ImageData object with the extracted information
3. For `sensor_msgs/CompressedImage` messages:
   - Determine the compression format (jpeg, png, etc.)
   - Use OpenCV to decompress the image
   - Create an ImageData object with the decompressed image
4. For H.264 encoded video:
   - Use `av.packet.Packet(message.data)` to create a packet
   - Decode with `codec_ctx.decode(packet)` where `codec_ctx` is created with `av.codec.CodecContext.create('h.264','r')`
   - Skip frames that fail to decode, as the stream will eventually output correctly after several frames
5. Extract camera ID from the topic name or message header
6. Convert ROS timestamp to seconds (nanoseconds to seconds)
7. Handle error cases gracefully with appropriate logging

## Dependencies
- `rosbags` Python library
- OpenCV for image processing
- PyAV for H.264 decoding
- Core data structures (ImageData class)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- The implementation should be platform-independent and not require a full ROS installation
- Consider memory efficiency for large datasets with many images
- Test with a variety of image formats and encodings
- Document any assumptions about image coordinate systems
- Consider implementing image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) for efficiency
- Ensure proper error handling for corrupted or partial images
