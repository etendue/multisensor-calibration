# Task Definition: T2.3.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T2.3.2
- **Task Name:** Implement prediction step (IMU)
- **Phase:** 2 (Initial Motion Estimation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement the prediction step of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) using IMU measurements. This step propagates the state vector and covariance matrix forward in time based on the IMU measurements and the process model. The prediction step is essential for accurate state estimation between wheel odometry updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement state propagation using IMU measurements
- [x] Implement covariance propagation using the process model
- [x] Handle quaternion normalization in the state propagation
- [x] Implement bias correction for IMU measurements
- [x] Support different integration methods (Euler, midpoint, RK4)
- [x] Handle edge cases (zero time difference, invalid measurements)
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Document the prediction step equations and assumptions
- [x] Ensure numerical stability of the covariance propagation

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Implement state propagation:
   - Correct IMU measurements using estimated biases
   - Integrate angular velocity to update orientation
   - Compensate for gravity based on current orientation
   - Integrate linear acceleration to update velocity and position
   - Update bias estimates based on random walk model
2. Implement covariance propagation:
   - Calculate the state transition matrix (Jacobian for EKF)
   - Calculate the process noise covariance matrix
   - Propagate the covariance matrix using the EKF or UKF equations
3. Handle quaternion normalization:
   - Normalize the quaternion after each integration step
   - Implement proper error state representation for orientation
4. Implement different integration methods:
   - Euler integration (first-order)
   - Midpoint method (second-order)
   - Runge-Kutta (fourth-order)
5. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use efficient matrix operations
   - Avoid redundant calculations
   - Implement analytical Jacobians where possible

## Dependencies
- Core data structures (ImuData, VehiclePose classes)
- State vector definition (T2.3.1)
- IMU integration module (T2.2)
- NumPy and SciPy for numerical operations

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- The prediction step is computationally intensive, especially for UKF
- Document assumptions about the process model and noise characteristics
- Consider implementing adaptive process noise based on vehicle dynamics
- Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- Consider implementing numerical stability checks for the covariance matrix
- Be aware of the limitations of the process model for complex vehicle dynamics
- Consider implementing multiple process models for different vehicle types
