# Task Definition: T3.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T3.2
- **Task Name:** Implement feature matching and tracking
- **Phase:** 3 (Visual Processing & Initialization)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement algorithms for matching features between images and tracking features across consecutive frames. This includes descriptor-based matching (e.g., BFMatcher, FLANN) for wide-baseline matching and optical flow-based tracking (e.g., KLT) for narrow-baseline tracking. Feature matching and tracking are essential for establishing correspondences between images, which is a prerequisite for Structure from Motion (SfM).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement descriptor-based feature matching (BFMatcher, FLANN)
- [x] Implement optical flow-based feature tracking (KLT)
- [x] Support different matching strategies (nearest neighbor, ratio test)
- [x] Implement geometric verification (e.g., RANSAC with fundamental matrix)
- [x] Handle outlier rejection in both matching and tracking
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Make matching and tracking parameters configurable
- [x] Document the matching and tracking interfaces and parameters
- [x] Implement visualization tools for matched and tracked features

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Implement descriptor-based matching:
   - Create a unified interface for different matchers (BFMatcher, FLANN)
   - Support different distance metrics (Hamming, L2) based on descriptor type
   - Implement matching strategies (nearest neighbor, k-nearest neighbors, ratio test)
   - Convert OpenCV matches to internal representation
2. Implement optical flow-based tracking:
   - Use Lucas-Kanade method for tracking features across consecutive frames
   - Handle feature status (tracked, lost) and tracking quality
   - Implement bidirectional tracking for improved robustness
3. Implement geometric verification:
   - Use RANSAC with fundamental matrix or homography for outlier rejection
   - Calculate inlier ratio and other quality metrics
   - Support different geometric models based on the scenario
4. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use appropriate data structures for efficient matching
   - Implement multi-threading for parallel processing
   - Use GPU acceleration where available
5. Make parameters configurable:
   - Matching thresholds and strategies
   - RANSAC parameters (iterations, threshold)
   - Tracking parameters (window size, termination criteria)
6. Implement visualization tools:
   - Draw matches between images
   - Visualize feature tracks across multiple frames
   - Create debug outputs for matching and tracking

## Dependencies
- OpenCV library
- Feature detection module (T3.1)
- Core data structures (Feature, Match classes)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- Consider the trade-off between matching accuracy and computational efficiency
- Document the characteristics of different matching and tracking methods
- Test with a variety of scenarios (wide baseline, narrow baseline, different lighting)
- Consider implementing cascade matching (first fast, then more accurate)
- Ensure proper handling of feature appearance changes due to viewpoint and lighting
- Consider implementing feature tracking recovery mechanisms
- Be aware of the limitations of different matching and tracking methods
