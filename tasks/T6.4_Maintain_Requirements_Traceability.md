# Task Definition: T6.4

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T6.4
- **Task Name:** Maintain Requirements Traceability Matrix
- **Phase:** 6 (Refinement & Release)
- **Status:** Ongoing

## Description
Establish and maintain a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) that maps requirements to implementation artifacts and test cases. This task ensures that all requirements are properly implemented and tested, and provides a clear mapping between requirements and code. The RTM will be used for impact analysis when requirements change and for verifying that all requirements are fulfilled.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create a Requirements Traceability Matrix document
- [x] Map all functional requirements to implementation artifacts
- [x] Map all non-functional requirements to implementation artifacts
- [x] Link requirements to test cases
- [x] Document the traceability details for each requirement
- [x] Update the PRD to reference the traceability matrix
- [x] Add traceability references in code comments
- [x] Establish a process for maintaining the traceability matrix
- [ ] Review the traceability matrix with the team
- [ ] Update the traceability matrix as the implementation evolves

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a Requirements Traceability Matrix document:
   - Include all functional and non-functional requirements
   - Map requirements to implementation artifacts (source files)
   - Map requirements to test artifacts (test files)
   - Track implementation status
2. Document traceability details:
   - Provide detailed descriptions of how each requirement is implemented
   - Link requirements to specific tasks
   - Include notes on implementation decisions
3. Add traceability references in code:
   - Add requirement IDs in code comments
   - Ensure code documentation references requirements
4. Establish a maintenance process:
   - Define how to update the matrix when requirements change
   - Define how to update the matrix when implementation changes
   - Define roles and responsibilities for maintaining the matrix
5. Integrate with development workflow:
   - Update the matrix as part of the development process
   - Review the matrix during code reviews
   - Use the matrix for impact analysis when requirements change

## Dependencies
- Complete implementation of all system components
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Technical Design Document (TDD)
- Test cases for all requirements

## Estimated Effort
Initial setup: 1-2 days
Ongoing maintenance: 1-2 hours per week

## Notes
- The traceability matrix should be a living document that evolves with the project
- Consider using a tool or script to help maintain the matrix
- The matrix should be accessible to all team members
- The matrix should be reviewed regularly to ensure it remains accurate
- Consider adding bidirectional traceability (from code to requirements and from requirements to code)
