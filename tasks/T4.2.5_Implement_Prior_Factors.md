# Task Definition: T4.2.5

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T4.2.5
- **Task Name:** Implement creation of prior factors
- **Phase:** 4 (Optimization Backend)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement functionality to create prior factors for the factor graph. Prior factors incorporate initial estimates and constraints into the optimization problem, providing regularization and helping to avoid degenerate solutions. These factors are essential for stable optimization and should be carefully configured based on the confidence in the initial estimates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement creation of prior factors for poses
- [x] Implement creation of prior factors for landmarks
- [x] Implement creation of prior factors for intrinsics
- [x] Implement creation of prior factors for extrinsics
- [x] Implement creation of prior factors for biases
- [x] Configure appropriate noise models based on confidence in initial estimates
- [x] Support different prior types (hard constraints, soft priors)
- [x] Document the prior factor creation process
- [x] Handle edge cases (unknown parameters, high uncertainty)

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a prior factor creation module that:
   - Takes initial estimates and configuration as input
   - Creates appropriate prior factors for different variable types
   - Configures noise models based on confidence in initial estimates
   - Adds factors to the factor graph
2. Implement pose prior factors:
   - Create PriorFactor<Pose3> for vehicle poses
   - Configure noise model based on pose uncertainty
   - Support different prior types (full pose, partial constraints)
3. Implement landmark prior factors:
   - Create PriorFactor<Point3> for landmarks with known positions
   - Configure noise model based on landmark uncertainty
   - Support different prior types (full position, partial constraints)
4. Implement calibration prior factors:
   - Create PriorFactor<Cal3_S2> (or similar) for camera intrinsics
   - Create PriorFactor<Pose3> for sensor extrinsics
   - Configure noise models based on calibration uncertainty
   - Support different prior types (full parameters, partial constraints)
5. Implement bias prior factors:
   - Create PriorFactor<imuBias::ConstantBias> for IMU biases
   - Configure noise model based on bias uncertainty
   - Support zero-mean priors for biases
6. Configure noise models:
   - Use diagonal noise models for uncorrelated parameters
   - Use full covariance models for correlated parameters
   - Scale noise based on confidence in initial estimates

## Dependencies
- GTSAM library (T4.1)
- Variable creation module (T4.2.1)
- Core data structures (VehiclePose, CameraIntrinsics, Extrinsics classes)

## Estimated Effort
1-2 days

## Notes
- Prior factors significantly impact the optimization behavior
- Document the rationale for each prior factor and its noise model
- Consider the trade-off between constraint strength and flexibility
- Test with different prior configurations to assess robustness
- Consider implementing adaptive priors based on optimization progress
- Be aware of the impact of priors on the optimization solution
- Consider implementing informative priors based on physical constraints
