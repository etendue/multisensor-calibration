# Task Definition: T5.2.2

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T5.2.2
- **Task Name:** Implement visualization (e.g., plot trajectory, project points into images)
- **Phase:** 5 (Integration, Validation & Documentation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement visualization tools for inspecting and validating the calibration results. These tools should provide intuitive visual representations of the calibrated parameters, vehicle trajectory, 3D landmarks, and reprojection errors. Effective visualization is essential for understanding the calibration results and identifying potential issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement visualization of vehicle trajectory
- [x] Implement visualization of 3D landmarks (point cloud)
- [x] Implement visualization of camera poses and fields of view
- [x] Implement projection of 3D points into images
- [x] Implement visualization of reprojection errors on images
- [x] Create interactive visualizations where possible
- [x] Support different visualization backends
- [x] Make visualization parameters configurable
- [x] Document the visualization tools and controls
- [x] Ensure visualizations are informative and user-friendly

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Create a visualization module that:
   - Takes calibration results and related data as input
   - Generates various visualizations based on the data
   - Supports interactive exploration where possible
   - Provides clear and informative visual feedback
2. Implement trajectory visualization:
   - Plot the vehicle trajectory in 3D space
   - Show keyframe poses with orientation
   - Use color coding for temporal information
   - Support different trajectory representations
3. Implement point cloud visualization:
   - Visualize 3D landmarks in the scene
   - Color-code points based on various attributes (error, number of observations)
   - Support filtering and sampling for large point clouds
   - Implement controls for point size, color, and visibility
4. Implement camera visualization:
   - Show camera poses and orientations
   - Visualize camera fields of view (frustums)
   - Highlight the relationship between cameras
   - Support different camera models
5. Implement image-based visualization:
   - Project 3D landmarks into images
   - Visualize reprojection errors with color coding
   - Show feature tracks across multiple frames
   - Support interactive selection of frames and features
6. Make visualizations configurable:
   - Read parameters from the configuration file
   - Support different color schemes and styles
   - Allow customization of visualization elements

## Dependencies
- Optimization backend (Phase 4)
- Visual initialization pipeline (Phase 3)
- Core data structures (Feature, Landmark, VehiclePose classes)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)
- Visualization libraries (matplotlib, Open3D, etc.)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- Consider using interactive 3D visualization libraries (Open3D, plotly, etc.)
- Document the controls and features of interactive visualizations
- Test with a variety of datasets to ensure robust visualization
- Consider implementing export of visualizations to common formats
- Ensure visualizations are informative and not overwhelming
- Consider implementing side-by-side comparison of different calibration runs
- Be aware of the computational requirements for visualization of large datasets
