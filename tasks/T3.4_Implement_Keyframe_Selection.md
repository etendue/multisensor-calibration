# Task Definition: T3.4

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T3.4
- **Task Name:** Implement keyframe selection logic
- **Phase:** 3 (Visual Processing & Initialization)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement logic for selecting keyframes from the continuous stream of camera images. Keyframes are a subset of frames that provide sufficient information for Structure from Motion (SfM) while reducing computational complexity. The keyframe selection should ensure good coverage of the scene, sufficient baseline for triangulation, and manageable computational requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement criteria for keyframe selection based on:
  - [x] Visual content change (feature tracking)
  - [x] Spatial distribution (vehicle motion)
  - [x] Temporal distribution (time intervals)
- [x] Support different keyframe selection strategies
- [x] Implement adaptive keyframe selection based on scene complexity
- [x] Handle multi-camera setups in keyframe selection
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Make keyframe selection parameters configurable
- [x] Document the keyframe selection interface and parameters
- [x] Implement visualization tools for selected keyframes

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Implement criteria for keyframe selection:
   - Visual content change: Select frames with significant changes in feature tracks
   - Spatial distribution: Select frames based on vehicle motion (translation, rotation)
   - Temporal distribution: Ensure keyframes are well-distributed in time
2. Implement different selection strategies:
   - Fixed interval selection (simplest approach)
   - Feature-based selection (based on feature tracking quality)
   - Motion-based selection (based on vehicle motion)
   - Hybrid approaches combining multiple criteria
3. Implement adaptive selection:
   - Adjust selection criteria based on scene complexity
   - Select more keyframes in complex environments
   - Select fewer keyframes in simple environments
4. Handle multi-camera setups:
   - Coordinate keyframe selection across multiple cameras
   - Ensure consistent keyframe selection for all cameras
   - Handle cases where some cameras have poor visibility
5. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use efficient metrics for evaluating keyframe candidates
   - Implement incremental selection (evaluate only new frames)
   - Use multi-threading for parallel processing
6. Implement visualization tools:
   - Visualize selected keyframes in a timeline
   - Show feature tracks across keyframes
   - Create debug outputs for keyframe selection

## Dependencies
- Feature detection module (T3.1)
- Feature matching and tracking module (T3.2)
- Core data structures (ImageData, Feature classes)
- Configuration parser (T1.5)
- Initial motion estimation (Phase 2)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- The quality of keyframe selection significantly impacts the SfM results
- Consider the trade-off between reconstruction quality and computational efficiency
- Test with different scenarios (urban, highway, parking lots)
- Consider implementing a two-pass approach (initial selection, then refinement)
- Ensure proper handling of degenerate cases (stationary vehicle, featureless environments)
- Document assumptions about the scene and vehicle motion
- Be aware of the impact of keyframe selection on the subsequent triangulation and optimization
