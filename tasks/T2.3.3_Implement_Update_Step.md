# Task Definition: T2.3.3

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** T2.3.3
- **Task Name:** Implement update step (Wheel Odometry)
- **Phase:** 2 (Initial Motion Estimation)
- **Status:** Completed

## Description
Implement the update step of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) using wheel odometry measurements. This step corrects the predicted state based on wheel odometry measurements, reducing the drift that accumulates during the prediction step. The update step is essential for maintaining accurate long-term state estimation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement measurement model for wheel odometry
- [x] Implement Kalman gain calculation
- [x] Implement state and covariance update equations
- [x] Handle different vehicle models (differential drive, Ackermann)
- [x] Implement outlier rejection for wheel odometry measurements
- [x] Handle partial measurements (e.g., only velocity or only position)
- [x] Optimize for computational efficiency
- [x] Document the update step equations and assumptions
- [x] Ensure numerical stability of the covariance update

## Implementation Details
The implementation should:
1. Implement measurement model:
   - Define the expected measurement based on the current state
   - Calculate the measurement Jacobian (for EKF)
   - Handle different vehicle models (differential drive, Ackermann)
2. Implement Kalman gain calculation:
   - Calculate the innovation covariance
   - Calculate the Kalman gain
   - Ensure numerical stability
3. Implement state and covariance update:
   - Calculate the measurement innovation (difference between actual and expected measurement)
   - Update the state using the Kalman gain and innovation
   - Update the covariance matrix
   - Normalize quaternion if orientation is updated
4. Implement outlier rejection:
   - Calculate Mahalanobis distance for the measurement
   - Reject measurements that exceed a threshold
   - Log rejected measurements for debugging
5. Handle partial measurements:
   - Support updates with only a subset of the measurement vector
   - Adjust the measurement model and Jacobian accordingly
6. Optimize for computational efficiency:
   - Use efficient matrix operations
   - Avoid redundant calculations
   - Implement analytical Jacobians where possible

## Dependencies
- Core data structures (WheelEncoderData, VehiclePose classes)
- State vector definition (T2.3.1)
- Wheel odometry module (T2.1)
- NumPy and SciPy for numerical operations

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- The measurement model depends on the vehicle type and wheel configuration
- Document assumptions about the measurement model and noise characteristics
- Consider implementing adaptive measurement noise based on vehicle dynamics
- Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known
- Consider implementing numerical stability checks for the covariance matrix
- Be aware of the limitations of wheel odometry on slippery surfaces
- Consider implementing multiple measurement models for different vehicle types
