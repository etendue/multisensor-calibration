def estimate_initial_ego_motion(imu_data: List[ImuData], wheel_data: List[WheelEncoderData], initial_pose: VehiclePose, axle_length: float) -> List[VehiclePose]:
    """
    Estimates an initial vehicle trajectory using IMU and wheel encoder data.

    Args:
        imu_data: List of synchronized IMU measurements.
        wheel_data: List of synchronized wheel encoder measurements.
        initial_pose: The starting pose of the vehicle.
        axle_length: The distance between the front/rear axles (or track width depending on model).

    Returns:
        A list of estimated VehiclePose objects representing the initial trajectory.
        This often involves techniques like:
        - Wheel Odometry: Calculating dx, dy, dyaw from wheel speeds/ticks.
            Requires wheel radius calibration (can be part of main BA or pre-calibrated).
            Model: e.g., differential drive or Ackermann steering model.
        - IMU Integration: Integrating angular velocities for orientation and
            double integrating accelerations (gravity compensated) for position. Prone to drift.
        - Sensor Fusion (e.g., EKF/UKF): Combining odometry and IMU to mitigate drift
            and improve accuracy.
