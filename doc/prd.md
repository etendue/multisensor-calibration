## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an offline software system designed to calibrate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of sensors commonly used in autonomous vehicles (cameras, IMU, wheel encoders). The system aims to achieve accurate calibration without relying on predefined calibration targets (e.g., checkerboards), using data collected during normal vehicle operation. Accurate sensor calibration is critical for reliable environment perception, localization, and sensor fusion in autonomous driving systems.

## 2. Goals

- **G1**: Develop a robust, targetless calibration system for camera intrinsics and sensor extrinsics (Camera-to-Vehicle, IMU-to-Vehicle).
- **G2**: Achieve high calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods under suitable conditions.
- **G3**: Provide a reliable offline tool for R&D and calibration teams working on autonomous vehicles.
- **G4**: Integrate measurements from cameras, IMU, and wheel encoders in a unified optimization framework.

## 3. Target Users

- **U1**: **Autonomous Driving R&D Engineers**: Need accurate calibration for developing and testing perception, localization, and fusion algorithms.
- **U2**: **Calibration Technicians/Engineers**: Responsible for calibrating sensor suites on prototype and production vehicles.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Input Data
The system must accept synchronized time-stamped data streams from:
- Multiple cameras (providing 360Â° view, format e.g., image files, video, ROS bag).
- One 6-axis IMU (angular velocity, linear acceleration, format e.g., CSV, ROS bag).
- Four wheel encoders (wheel speeds or ticks, format e.g., CSV, ROS bag).

### FR2: Calibration Scope
- Estimate intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) for each camera.
- Estimate extrinsic parameters (6 DoF pose: rotation and translation) for each camera relative to the vehicle reference frame.
- Estimate extrinsic parameters (6 DoF pose) for the IMU relative to the vehicle reference frame.
- (Optional) Estimate IMU biases (gyroscope and accelerometer).

### FR3: Targetless Operation
The calibration process must not require the use of predefined calibration targets or patterns in the environment.

### FR4: Offline Processing
The system is designed to run offline on collected datasets, not in real-time on the vehicle.

### FR5: Coordinate System
The calibration results (extrinsics) must be expressed relative to a clearly defined vehicle-centric coordinate system (Origin: Center of rear axle; X: Forward, Y: Left, Z: Up).

### FR6: Input Assumptions
- Approximate initial guesses for camera intrinsic parameters must be provided.
- Approximate initial guesses for sensor extrinsic parameters (relative poses) should be provided (e.g., from CAD models or rough measurements).
- Known vehicle parameters (front/rear axle lengths) must be provided.
- Sensors must be rigidly mounted to the vehicle body.
- Data must be reasonably synchronized (system may include fine-tuning of time offsets).

### FR7: Output
- The system must output the estimated intrinsic parameters for each camera.
- The system must output the estimated extrinsic parameters (rotation, translation) for each camera and the IMU relative to the vehicle frame.
- The system must output quality metrics (e.g., final reprojection error, parameter covariance).
- Output format should be easily parseable (e.g., YAML, JSON).

### FR8: Validation
The system should provide tools or metrics to assess the quality of the calibration (e.g., visualization of aligned point clouds, reprojection error statistics).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Accuracy
- Target reprojection error: < 0.5 pixels (RMS).
- Target extrinsic translation error: < 2 cm (relative to ground truth, if available).
- Target extrinsic rotation error: < 0.2 degrees (relative to ground truth, if available).
- *(Note: Achievable accuracy depends heavily on data quality and motion diversity).*

### NFR2: Performance
The system should process a typical dataset (e.g., 10 minutes of driving at 10Hz cameras, 100Hz IMU) within a reasonable timeframe on standard desktop hardware (e.g., < 2 hours).

### NFR3: Robustness
The system should be robust to moderate levels of sensor noise and function across a variety of driving scenarios (urban, highway, parking lots) provided sufficient excitation exists. It should handle potential outliers in measurements.

### NFR4: Usability
The system should be runnable via a command-line interface with clear configuration options. Documentation should guide users on data preparation and execution.

### NFR5: Maintainability
Code should be well-structured, commented, and adhere to standard Python practices.

## 6. Success Criteria

- **SC1**: Successful calibration (convergence) on >90% of diverse, good-quality datasets.
- **SC2**: Achieved accuracy targets (NFR1) on benchmark datasets with known ground truth.
- **SC3**: Calibration results demonstrably improve the performance of downstream tasks (e.g., SLAM, object detection) compared to using initial guesses.
- **SC4**: Positive feedback from target users (U1, U2) regarding usability and reliability.

## 7. Requirement Traceability

A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) has been established to track the implementation of each requirement. The RTM maps requirements to implementation artifacts (source code files), test artifacts, and tracks the implementation status.

See [Requirements Traceability Matrix](requirements_traceability.md) for details.

## 8. Future Considerations

- Online/real-time calibration capabilities.
- Support for additional sensor types (e.g., LiDAR, Radar).
- Automatic estimation of initial parameter guesses.
- GUI for easier configuration and visualization.
- Calibration of wheel radii/scale factors.
